//The quick sort approach seems similar to how books are sorted in actual libraries. If we were to covert the book
//titles to lower case and examine their character codes we would be able to use a quick sort algorithm to sort them
//alphabetically 

// step 1 find a book close to beginning or end of alphabet

// step 2 find other books that start with the same letter

// step 3 move second book to the correct side of first book

// step 4 continue to find books that start with the same letter and place them between the already placed books, in order

// step 5 repeat with other letters
